The principal reason for today\u2019s downturn was the sudden imposition of an additional 25% tariff by the US on Indian exports\u2014taking the total to 50%\u2014which rattled investor sentiment and led to sharp early losses across indices. Looking forward, the sentiment is expected to remain cautious with markets likely to remain rangebound as participants wait for more clarity on the India\u2013US trade standoff and the global interest rate outlook. Any signs of resolution in tariffs or positive developments in global markets could lend support, but further FII outflows and pressure on bank stocks may cap near-term gains.\u201d\nAugust 28, 2025 16:05\nClosing bell: Kansai Nerolac Paints has opened a sales depot at Nanded, Maharashtra\nAugust 28, 2025 16:05\nClosing bell: Rupee rises 6 paise to close at 87.63 against US dollar\nThe rupee rose by 6 paise to close at 87.63 (provisional) against the US dollar on Thursday aided by a weaker greenback and a decline in crude oil prices.\nHowever, concerns over additional US tariffs on Indian products, which kicked in on Wednesday, and a decline in domestic equity markets capped gains in the local unit, according to forex traders.\nThe US government has imposed a total of 50 per cent tariffs on Indian exports to America, barring a few sectors.\nRupee rises 6 paise to close at 87.63 against US dollar\nThe rupee rose by 6 paise to close at 87.63 (provisional) against the US dollar on Thursday aided by a weaker greenback and a decline in crude oil prices.\nAugust 28, 2025 15:51\nCurrency update: Rupee rises 6 paise to close at 87.63 (provisional) against US dollar.\nAugust 28, 2025 15:47\nStock market live: Sensex ended 705.97 pts or 0.87% lower at 80,080.57; Nifty 50 fell 211.15 pts or 0.85% to 24,500.90\nSensex ended 705.97 pts or 0.87 per cent lower at 80,080.57 (close to intraday low of 80,013.02).

Kamath, Chairman, JFSL; and Mr. Hitesh Sethia, MD & CEO, JFSL.\nExcerpts from the address of Mr. K.V. Kamath, Chairman, JFSL\nIndia is on the threshold of an extraordinary decade. With a young population, rising income levels, policy-led reforms, a strong infrastructure push, and digital adoption at scale, our economy is well-placed to sustain a GDP growth of around 6.5-7%, making it the fastest growing major economy in the world.\nOne of the most remarkable achievements in recent years has been the creation of a robust digital public infrastructure. These platforms are helping bridge the rural\u2013urban divide, bringing millions of first-time users into the fold of the formal economy, and enabling a new age digital ecosystem that is inclusive and equitable.\nFY25 was a pivotal year for our Company. During this period, we scaled our existing businesses, successfully operationalized new ventures, secured key regulatory approvals for new businesses to come, and implemented a sophisticated data intelligence engine, which will form the backbone of our personalised and intelligent financial services offerings for customers.\nExcerpts from the address of Mr. Hitesh Sethia, MD & CEO, JFSL\nOur businesses such as the NBFC, the asset management JV with BlackRock, the payments bank, the payment solutions vertical, and the insurance broking arm are off to a robust start and continue to scale up\u2026even as we firm up our go-to-market plans for our other proposed ventures, including the JVs with BlackRock for wealth management and broking, as well as our recently announced partnership with Allianz for insurance.\nWe have ambitious plans of becoming a leading, full-stack financial services institution with significant market share. The Company is in a strategic build-out phase at the moment, with diverse businesses which are either being scaled up or newly incubated.\nOur business model is uniquely structured to fund its expansion directly from the return on our shareholders\u2019 capital, even as the core capital base itself provides us sufficient cushion. This approach allows us to grow sustainably, with disciplined allocation of resources. At this juncture of our growth journey, conventional valuation metrics may not fully capture the intrinsic value of our model.\nA key monitorable for us is the steady increase in income from business operations (~40% of consolidated total net income in Q1 FY26, up from ~12% in Q1FY 25), which highlights the growing strength of our core activities, and will be a key driver of our future success.\nThe JioFinance app, our primary digital storefront for retail customers, which is also embedded within the MyJio app, continued to gain traction over this period. In Q1 FY26, we served an average 8.1 million Monthly Active Users across all our digital properties.\nOur app has seen significant traction in user engagement, especially with new products like JioBlackRock\u2019s mutual funds and features such as tax filing and planning going live.\nAlongside our in-house product suite, we have also entered into tie-ups with trusted partner brands to bring our customers a range of solutions, including digital gold, life and general insurance, and tax filing and planning, which are complementary to our offerings.\nOver the coming months, you\u2019ll see us entering more such strategic tie-ups with leading financial services providers to further expand our portfolio with new products, designed to cater to the financial needs of our customers holistically.\nAugust 28, 2025 15:15\nStock market live news: Dev Information Technology has secured a significant work order from RajCOMP Info Services Ltd., a Government of Rajasthan undertaking; Shares zoom 7% on the NSE to Rs 44.41.\nAugust 28, 2025 15:14\nStock market live updates today: Protean awarded UIDAI mandate to strengthen Aadhaar services across 188 districts in India\nProtean eGov Technologies Ltd.

This threatens India\u2019s gems and jewellery industry specially, as America is its largest market, worth over $10 billion driving almost 30 per cent of the industry\u2019s entire global trade. Exports to America could drop by more than 50 per cent since these tariffs are put in effect, risking both revenues and jobs in major manufacturing clusters.\nA comprehensive urgent policy drive can mitigate the tariff shocks confronting India\u2019s gems and jewellery sector, safeguard jobs and maintain its world leadership. USA tariff headwinds has threatened the Indian natural diamond, gold jewellery, and lab-grown segment demand, although collective reforms can dilute the effect and open up new growth. India is at a juncture to become a world, innovation-driven export destination, but there has to be immediate and definitive reforms to upheld this position. Some of the reforms and actions required are :\n* The labour laws need to be made simpler in order to ensure compliance, contract transparency, and better worker welfare which is the key to enhanced productivity and investments.\n* The pending amendment to the SEZ Act should be notified forthwith to make SEZ units survive and remain competitive especially reverse job work.\n* For e-commerce , India has to compete with international centres such as Dubai and Hong Kong on cost and speed so by lowering logistics compliance and streamlining payments modalities, returns, and freight rules.\n* GST should be simplified with one-stage model to lower compliance costs and blockage of working capital, particularly for exporters on input credits.\n* On the same lines, income tax policies have to be export-oriented with lower rates, simplified transfer pricing laws, and time-bound resolution of disputes. Also Quick refunds are critical for liquidity and competitiveness.\nInterest subvention on export credit, pre- and post-shipment needs to be assured for a minimum of five years to safeguard employment and assist MSMEs in handling the demand cycles.\n* Strategic BTAs with China, Brazil, South Africa, and the EU need to be expedited, emphasizing predictable rules of origin, reduced non-tariff barriers, and safeguards for high-value segments such as certified diamonds and branded jewellery.\n* Key sectors like diamond cutting, gold jewellery, synthetic gemstones, and parts need to be facilitated by finance access, traceability standards, and compliance with international trade regulations . This would stabilise orders and promote investment.\nIt is extremely important for India to position itself as a dependable, price-competitive, and policy-stable world export leader. These reforms if put to action can reduce the impact of Trade tariffs on the Indian Gems and Jewellery industry.\u201d\nAugust 28, 2025 13:29\nStock market live updates today: Sensex, Nifty extend losses as US tariff impact weighs on export stocks\nBenchmark indices remained under pressure during midday trading on Thursday, with the Sensex down 446.01 points or 0.55 per cent at 80,340.53 and the Nifty 50 declining 120.90 points or 0.49 per cent to 24,591.15 as of 12.30 pm.

In my opinion this is a pure liquidity-driven selling rather than concerns over IndiGo\u2019s business fundamentals. Today\u2019s 5% decline appears overdone, driven by immediate supply pressure and weak Q2 operating metrics affected by geopolitical disruptions and yield compression. \nThe sharp selloff, however, presents a compelling accumulation opportunity for long-term investors. Management\u2019s constructive outlook for H2FY26 recovery appears credible, with double-digit capacity expansion resuming in Q3-Q4, backed by international route additions to London and Copenhagen. \nThe anticipated A321XLR deliveries will provide additional growth prospects until CY26. \nDespite short-term headwinds from seasonal domestic weakness and fleet optimisation problems, IndiGo\u2019s strong market position, large orderbook, and secured slots at major airports (Jewar, Navi Mumbai) position the company well for the medium term.\n- Nitant Darekar Research Analyst at Bonanza\nAugust 28, 2025 11:54\nIndiGo share price live today: Shares down nearly 5% \nShares of Interglobe Aviation declined 4.74% to \u20b95763.50 on the NSE at 11.53 am.\nAugust 28, 2025 11:37\nIndiGo share price today live: Shares down  \nIndiGo shares fell 4.31% on the NSE to \u20b95,789.50 as at 11.36 am.

The principal reason for today\u2019s downturn was the sudden imposition of an additional 25% tariff by the US on Indian exports\u2014taking the total to 50%\u2014which rattled investor sentiment and led to sharp early losses across indices. Looking forward, the sentiment is expected to remain cautious with markets likely to remain rangebound as participants wait for more clarity on the India\u2013US trade standoff and the global interest rate outlook. Any signs of resolution in tariffs or positive developments in global markets could lend support, but further FII outflows and pressure on bank stocks may cap near-term gains.\u201d\nAugust 28, 2025 16:05\nClosing bell: Kansai Nerolac Paints has opened a sales depot at Nanded, Maharashtra\nAugust 28, 2025 16:05\nClosing bell: Rupee rises 6 paise to close at 87.63 against US dollar\nThe rupee rose by 6 paise to close at 87.63 (provisional) against the US dollar on Thursday aided by a weaker greenback and a decline in crude oil prices.\nHowever, concerns over additional US tariffs on Indian products, which kicked in on Wednesday, and a decline in domestic equity markets capped gains in the local unit, according to forex traders.\nThe US government has imposed a total of 50 per cent tariffs on Indian exports to America, barring a few sectors.\nRupee rises 6 paise to close at 87.63 against US dollar\nThe rupee rose by 6 paise to close at 87.63 (provisional) against the US dollar on Thursday aided by a weaker greenback and a decline in crude oil prices.\nAugust 28, 2025 15:51\nCurrency update: Rupee rises 6 paise to close at 87.63 (provisional) against US dollar.\nAugust 28, 2025 15:47\nStock market live: Sensex ended 705.97 pts or 0.87% lower at 80,080.57; Nifty 50 fell 211.15 pts or 0.85% to 24,500.90\nSensex ended 705.97 pts or 0.87 per cent lower at 80,080.57 (close to intraday low of 80,013.02).

Kamath, Chairman, JFSL; and Mr. Hitesh Sethia, MD & CEO, JFSL.\nExcerpts from the address of Mr. K.V. Kamath, Chairman, JFSL\nIndia is on the threshold of an extraordinary decade. With a young population, rising income levels, policy-led reforms, a strong infrastructure push, and digital adoption at scale, our economy is well-placed to sustain a GDP growth of around 6.5-7%, making it the fastest growing major economy in the world.\nOne of the most remarkable achievements in recent years has been the creation of a robust digital public infrastructure. These platforms are helping bridge the rural\u2013urban divide, bringing millions of first-time users into the fold of the formal economy, and enabling a new age digital ecosystem that is inclusive and equitable.\nFY25 was a pivotal year for our Company. During this period, we scaled our existing businesses, successfully operationalized new ventures, secured key regulatory approvals for new businesses to come, and implemented a sophisticated data intelligence engine, which will form the backbone of our personalised and intelligent financial services offerings for customers.\nExcerpts from the address of Mr. Hitesh Sethia, MD & CEO, JFSL\nOur businesses such as the NBFC, the asset management JV with BlackRock, the payments bank, the payment solutions vertical, and the insurance broking arm are off to a robust start and continue to scale up\u2026even as we firm up our go-to-market plans for our other proposed ventures, including the JVs with BlackRock for wealth management and broking, as well as our recently announced partnership with Allianz for insurance.\nWe have ambitious plans of becoming a leading, full-stack financial services institution with significant market share. The Company is in a strategic build-out phase at the moment, with diverse businesses which are either being scaled up or newly incubated.\nOur business model is uniquely structured to fund its expansion directly from the return on our shareholders\u2019 capital, even as the core capital base itself provides us sufficient cushion. This approach allows us to grow sustainably, with disciplined allocation of resources. At this juncture of our growth journey, conventional valuation metrics may not fully capture the intrinsic value of our model.\nA key monitorable for us is the steady increase in income from business operations (~40% of consolidated total net income in Q1 FY26, up from ~12% in Q1FY 25), which highlights the growing strength of our core activities, and will be a key driver of our future success.\nThe JioFinance app, our primary digital storefront for retail customers, which is also embedded within the MyJio app, continued to gain traction over this period. In Q1 FY26, we served an average 8.1 million Monthly Active Users across all our digital properties.\nOur app has seen significant traction in user engagement, especially with new products like JioBlackRock\u2019s mutual funds and features such as tax filing and planning going live.\nAlongside our in-house product suite, we have also entered into tie-ups with trusted partner brands to bring our customers a range of solutions, including digital gold, life and general insurance, and tax filing and planning, which are complementary to our offerings.\nOver the coming months, you\u2019ll see us entering more such strategic tie-ups with leading financial services providers to further expand our portfolio with new products, designed to cater to the financial needs of our customers holistically.\nAugust 28, 2025 15:15\nStock market live news: Dev Information Technology has secured a significant work order from RajCOMP Info Services Ltd., a Government of Rajasthan undertaking; Shares zoom 7% on the NSE to Rs 44.41.\nAugust 28, 2025 15:14\nStock market live updates today: Protean awarded UIDAI mandate to strengthen Aadhaar services across 188 districts in India\nProtean eGov Technologies Ltd.

This threatens India\u2019s gems and jewellery industry specially, as America is its largest market, worth over $10 billion driving almost 30 per cent of the industry\u2019s entire global trade. Exports to America could drop by more than 50 per cent since these tariffs are put in effect, risking both revenues and jobs in major manufacturing clusters.\nA comprehensive urgent policy drive can mitigate the tariff shocks confronting India\u2019s gems and jewellery sector, safeguard jobs and maintain its world leadership. USA tariff headwinds has threatened the Indian natural diamond, gold jewellery, and lab-grown segment demand, although collective reforms can dilute the effect and open up new growth. India is at a juncture to become a world, innovation-driven export destination, but there has to be immediate and definitive reforms to upheld this position. Some of the reforms and actions required are :\n* The labour laws need to be made simpler in order to ensure compliance, contract transparency, and better worker welfare which is the key to enhanced productivity and investments.\n* The pending amendment to the SEZ Act should be notified forthwith to make SEZ units survive and remain competitive especially reverse job work.\n* For e-commerce , India has to compete with international centres such as Dubai and Hong Kong on cost and speed so by lowering logistics compliance and streamlining payments modalities, returns, and freight rules.\n* GST should be simplified with one-stage model to lower compliance costs and blockage of working capital, particularly for exporters on input credits.\n* On the same lines, income tax policies have to be export-oriented with lower rates, simplified transfer pricing laws, and time-bound resolution of disputes. Also Quick refunds are critical for liquidity and competitiveness.\nInterest subvention on export credit, pre- and post-shipment needs to be assured for a minimum of five years to safeguard employment and assist MSMEs in handling the demand cycles.\n* Strategic BTAs with China, Brazil, South Africa, and the EU need to be expedited, emphasizing predictable rules of origin, reduced non-tariff barriers, and safeguards for high-value segments such as certified diamonds and branded jewellery.\n* Key sectors like diamond cutting, gold jewellery, synthetic gemstones, and parts need to be facilitated by finance access, traceability standards, and compliance with international trade regulations . This would stabilise orders and promote investment.\nIt is extremely important for India to position itself as a dependable, price-competitive, and policy-stable world export leader. These reforms if put to action can reduce the impact of Trade tariffs on the Indian Gems and Jewellery industry.\u201d\nAugust 28, 2025 13:29\nStock market live updates today: Sensex, Nifty extend losses as US tariff impact weighs on export stocks\nBenchmark indices remained under pressure during midday trading on Thursday, with the Sensex down 446.01 points or 0.55 per cent at 80,340.53 and the Nifty 50 declining 120.90 points or 0.49 per cent to 24,591.15 as of 12.30 pm.

The Indian government\u2019s decision will ease the burden of the Indian textile industry, particularly mills in the south, which are under pressure due to the 50 per cent tariffs imposed by the US government. It will help Indian textiles and garments to be competitive in markets such as the United Kingdom (UK) and the European Union with who it has signed trade deals.\nThis decision will likely result in cotton imports during the first three months of the marketing year 2025-26, starting in October, doubling to around 20 lakh bales of 170 kg each. This is the second time the Goverment has come to the rescue of the textiles industry in 10 days. On August 19, the government had exempted the 11 per cent duty on cotton imports till September end.\nAtul Ganatra, President, Cotton Association of India (CAI), said the extension of duty exemption will provide relief to Indian textile mills, especially those in the South. They can now get access to cheaper cotton from countries like Brazil, the US, Africa and Australia. \u201cIt will give a lifeline to the mills in South,\u201d Ganatra said, adding that CAI had recently urged the government to extend the duty-free imports for a few more months.\nGlobal prices ruling lower\nInternational prices are currently lower by about 20 per cent compared with Indian domestic prices. Cotton futures on the InterContinental Exchange (ICE), New York, are hovering at 67-68 cents per pound, equivalent to \u20b946,000 per candy of 356 kg in the Indian rupee, while domestic prices are hovering around \u20b955,000 per candy, Ganatra said.\nFor the current marketing year 2024-25 ending September, imports are expected to be between 40 and 42 lakh bales. \u201cDuring the October-December, we believe 15-20 lakh bales will arrive, compared with 10 lakh bales in the corresponding period last year,\u201d Ganatra said.\nAlso read\nMerchant association seeks EMI facility for gold jewellery purchase to boost retail biz\nICE futures are under pressure due to a bigger crop in Brazil, which is 7 per cent higher at 235 lakh bales, while their domestic consumption is only 30 lakh bales, he said. As Brazilian cotton is cheap, no one is buying US cotton. China, the biggest buyer, has not been buying US cotton over the past six months due to the tariff war. It has levied a 30 per cent tariff on US cotton. India\u2019s cotton imports from Brazil have seen a 10-fold increase during the current 2024-25 season to over 6.5 lakh bales valued at over \u20b91,620 crore till the end of May. \nGanatra said the Indian textile exports are linked to the yarn prices, which are linked to the ICE Futures.

It is all set to come into force from April 1, 2026.\nThis is the second draft of the Bill that has been passed, following the withdrawal of an earlier draft by the Finance Ministry to make changes recommended by a Select Committee of the Lok Sabha. Amidst the rigmarole, taxpayers seem to have certain questions in their mind regarding the new legislation. Here\u2019s addressing a few.\nWhy was the initial draft of the I-T Bill withdrawn?\nAccording to Neeraj Agarwala, Partner, Nangia & Co LLP, \u201cThe new Income Tax Bill was initially withdrawn to correct drafting inconsistencies and to carefully consider the feedback received from various stakeholders. For example, in the first draft, taxpayers were required to file their return on or before the due date of original filing, in order to claim refund. While it did allow filing a belated return, this condition was considered restrictive when compared to the provisions under the existing Income Tax Act, 1961 (ITA). To address such issues, the draft was sent back for revision, and the Parliamentary Select Committee recommended several changes that were subsequently incorporated into the new version.\u201d\nWhat are the key changes proposed in the revised version?\nAccording to Agarwala, \u201cAmong the important modifications was the treatment of pre-construction interest deduction. The earlier draft permitted this deduction only for self-occupied property, whereas the ITA extends the benefit to both self-occupied and let-out properties. The revised version has corrected this anomaly.\u201d\nAnother important correction relates to the rebate under section 87A. Under the ITA, marginal relief is available to resident individuals under the new tax regime if their total income exceeds \u20b912 lakh. This safeguard was missing in the initial draft but has been reinstated.\nSimilarly, the ITA provided taxpayers with the facility to obtain both lower TDS and nil-TDS certificates, albeit for specified receipts. The first draft of the bill failed to explicitly recognize nil-TDS certificates, which has now been addressed.\nHow does advance nil-TDS certification help?\n\u201cAn advance nil-TDS certificate helps a taxpayer by preventing unnecessary tax deductions at source when their income is either exempt from tax or their total tax liability is expected to be nil. Without such a certificate, the payers are obligated to withhold TDS, often creating a situation where the taxpayer has to claim a refund while filing the return, leading to cash flow issues.\nBy obtaining a nil-TDS certificate in advance, the taxpayer ensures that no tax is deducted at source, thereby improving liquidity, and aligning the actual tax deducted with their final liability\u201d, says Agarwala.\nWhat are the changes proposed in commuted pensions or lumpsum pension payments received by some individuals?\nIn fact, there are no changes proposed in this regard. The new law just presents the earlier provisions in a table within section 19, for better comprehension.\nCommuted pension received by employees of the Central Government or government of the States or a corporation established by a Central Act or State Act remain exempt.\nFor other employees, such as employees serving a private organization, commuted pension remains taxable with a deduction from the actual amount, as earlier. For those who are in receipt of gratuity, the deduction is one-third of the commuted pension. For others, it is half of the commuted pension.\nFurther, commuted pension from a pension scheme with an IRDAI-approved insurer remains outside taxation ambit, as it has been earlier.\nWhat does clause 202(1) under the revised Income-tax Bill specify?\nClause 202(1) houses the provisions that relate to the new tax regime applicable to individuals and HUFs among others. Here, the provisions stay the same as contained in the extant section 115BAC of ITA. The new slabs that were introduced in Budget 2025 and provisions with respect to the restrictions on claiming deductions and exemptions under section 115BAC are all carried over and there are no notable changes.\nCOMMENTS\nPublished on August 28, 2025\nREAD MORE", "timestamp": "2025-08-28T18:10:44.848081"}, {"title": "Adani Group portfolio companies\u2019 EBITDA crosses \u20b990,000 cr milestone for first time", "sub_heading": "Adani Group portfolio companies\u2019 Q1 FY26 EBITDA also rises to record high of \u20b923,793 crore", "publisher": "By BL Ahmedabad Bureau\nUpdated - August 28, 2025 at 11:44 AM. | Ahmedabad", "story": "The EBITDA for AEL\u2019s existing businesses declined by 18.7% year-on-year on a TTM basis, while those of AEL\u2019s cements and infrastructure business grew by 39.6% and 11.2%, respectively.  | Photo Credit: VIJAY SONEJI\nAnnouncing the financial performance of the companies in its portfolio, the Adani Group on Thursday said the EBITDA (short for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) for the companies crossed the \u20b990,000 crore milestone on a Trailing-Twelve-Month (TTM) basis for the first time with the first quarter EBITDA for FY2026 reaching a record high.\n\u201cThis strong performance was led by sustained growth in incubating businesses (notably Airports under AEL), along with Adani Green Energy, Adani Energy Solutions, Adani Ports & SEZ and Ambuja Cements.

The irony is striking: the US is actively negotiating with Russia and China, the latter being the largest buyer of Russian oil, yet chooses to target India with tariffs instead.

This moment should be no different. Rather than intimidate us, these global headwinds must galvanise India into bold, once-in-a-generation reforms, while also diversifying our export markets to secure long-term growth and resilience,\" he concluded.\nEarlier this month, speaking to ANI about India's trade relationship with China, Kant said that despite difficult political ties, India should aim at building joint ventures with Chinese companies, rather than depending heavily on imports from China. He explained, \"We do about 120 billion worth of imports from China. Despite having a very adverse relationship with Japan, China continued to maintain a very close economic relationship with Japan. China has a very adverse political relationship with Taiwan. Yet the biggest investors in China are Taiwan and the Taiwanese businessmen. To my mind, it is in our economic interest that instead of importing from China, we should get Chinese to do joint ventures with Indian companies on a minority stake and do manufacturing in India, and that will enable India to do both input manufacturing and component manufacturing and accelerate the process of Make in India and accelerate the process of Manufacture in India, and that to my mind is a long term answer to economic growth.\"\nOn India's growth ambitions, Kant pointed to the larger economic vision. \"The key is how do we take India from a $4 trillion to a $35 trillion economy by the time we become 100? That's the vision of the Prime Minister. We need to provide momentum for growth. We need to grow at 8 to 9 per cent per annum, year after year. Instead of importing, we should focus on manufacturing in India with China. That will create jobs in India,\" he said.\nCOMMENTS\nPublished on August 28, 2025\nREAD MORE", "timestamp": "2025-08-28T18:10:47.110122"}, {"title": "Are quality control orders really about quality?", "sub_heading": "While the aim is to build a robust manufacturing ecosystem, these orders often create supply chain disruptions", "publisher": "By Prerna Prabhakar\nUpdated - August 26, 2025 at 09:40 PM.", "story": "India\u2019s protectionist approach has become more aggressive in recent years, particularly since 2018  | Photo Credit: mady70\nRecently announced US tariffs have led to considerable speculation regarding India\u2019s risks and opportunities, with discussions emerging on India exploring alternatives to the US market. However, this debate has also brought to light some of the fundamental issues with India\u2019s trade and competitiveness strategy. While the agriculture sector faces high tariffs in many countries, including the US, India maintains one of the highest tariff levels for its non-agriculture sector as well.\nIndia\u2019s protectionist approach has become more aggressive in recent years, particularly since 2018, when tariffs began rising sharply. This trend was reinforced in 2020 with restrictions on Chinese investments, alongside the sustained implementation of anti-dumping duties targeted at preventing the inflow of cheap imports into India.\nIn parallel, the government has been issuing a series of Quality Control Orders (QCOs), with their number rising substantially since 2020. While these orders are designed by the respective line ministries, enforcement is undertaken by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). QCOs apply to both domestic producers and importers, though some ministries exempt imports intended for exports. These orders prescribe specific product standards, with consignments subject to testing for compliance. Based on test results, BIS issues certificates to producers or importers.\nAlthough the stated aim of QCOs is to build a robust manufacturing ecosystem in India, they have also created supply chain disruptions. Delays in certificate issuance for certain importers, often suppliers of critical components, have increased lead times for both manufacturers and exporters. Lengthy testing procedures further worsen these constraints.\nAccording to BIS, the orders are issued on grounds including public interest, protection of human, animal, or plant health, environmental safety, prevention of unfair trade practices, and national security. While quality assurance is a valid and essential objective, pricing-related concerns are already addressed through other measures such as anti-dumping duties, many of which have been levied against China. Targeting price differences for curbing imports of key intermediate items can lead to severe supply chain disruptions.\nFor instance, Chinese exporters of cold rolled grain-oriented (CRGO) steel, primarily used in the production of power transformers, were not granted BIS certification under the QCO. This led to shortages in the domestic market, as India does not produce this specialised grade of steel in sufficient quantities. The shortage had a direct impact on the power sector, even creating bottlenecks in infrastructure projects that rely on transformers. Eventually, the government considered granting some early exemptions to the Chinese importers of CRGO steel.\nFor curbing cheaper imports?\nThe bigger question then arises, whether such QCOs are primarily intended to ensure quality or to restrict the inflow of cheaper imports into the country.\nFor instance, a microenterprise producing steel kitchenware noted that a QCO prescribed specific thickness requirements for steel bowls. Because these specifications differed from their existing production standards, significant retrofitting was needed to comply. However, this raised an important question \u2014 whether thickness is directly related to health or environmental concerns, or whether it simply enforces a manufacturing specification that may not be critical for consumer safety. In the same way, there is a QCO covering steel wire used for hand-sewing needles, which mandates compliance with testing requirements such as chemical composition, wire dimensions, etc.\nDirect link\nIt is often difficult to establish a direct link between such QCOs and broader safety or environmental outcomes, raising the question of the extent to which these measures genuinely contribute to improvements in these parameters. Ultimately, the basis for introducing QCOs \u2014 whether rooted in genuine quality, safety, or environmental needs, or serving as indirect trade restrictions \u2014 must be better understood.\nCatering to price differences without careful consideration of domestic supply chain dynamics can hurt the competitiveness of India\u2019s manufacturing sector, which is already struggling and disadvantaged compared to its competitors.\nAt a time when countries are actively seeking alternative markets and striking trade deals with the US, India should focus on aligning its internal policies so that they are true to their stated objectives. Policies should avoid creating unintended hindrances for importers that ultimately restrict market access within the country and undermine the country\u2019s ability to attract foreign investments. Ensuring this balance is critical for strengthening India\u2019s manufacturing base and positioning it competitively in global trade.\nThe writer is an Associate Fellow at the Centre for Social and Economic Progress (CSEP).

A better FIT", "sub_heading": "Slight revisions in inflation target and range may work", "publisher": "Updated - August 26, 2025 at 09:38 PM.", "story": "The RBI paper is in favour of retaining the headline inflation for inflation targetiing given food\u2019s dominance in the consumption basket | Photo Credit: SUSHIL KUMAR VERMA\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently issued a discussion paper on whether the terms and conditions of \u2018flexible inflation targeting\u2019 (FIT) require a review. FIT, which began in 2016, comes up for a five-year extension in March 2026. The paper supports continuing with the point target of 4 per cent, but subtly favours reducing the range to 1.5 percentage points on either side from the present two percentage points. There is arguably room for raising the point target a bit. A higher target can take into account the outsized role of food prices in headline inflation in times of climate disruption.\nThe paper examines four broad questions, besides assessing the performance of FIT over nine years. These are: whether core inflation (non-food and non-fuel) should replace headline inflation as the target; the 4 per cent target should be persisted with; the tolerance band should be reduced; and a range should replace the point target. The paper is quite right in arguing that headline inflation (food and fuel inflation component exceeding 50 per cent) should remain the metric to reflect the common man\u2019s experience. According to the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (which points to a falling share of food consumption over time), 90 per cent of the lowest fractile rural households and 50 per cent of the lowest fractile urban households spend over half of their budget on food and fuel. Measuring food inflation becomes important, as food spills over to core inflation through costs and expectations. However, food weights should be adjusted periodically to reflect changing consumer preferences. The paper wryly observes that of the 48 countries practising FIT only Uganda has chosen to target core inflation. There may be a case for reducing the tolerance band by 0.5 percentage points on either side, provided the volatility and \u2018noise\u2019 in the food constituents of the retail price index is minimised. A narrower band would hold monetary authorities more to account.\nThe 4 per cent target seems to be the trend rate over nine years of FIT, besides being one that can be deduced through the Balassa-Samuelson effect \u2013 the sum of the inflation target of 2 per cent for advanced economies and a productivity differential between advanced and emerging economies. Out of 35 quarters, headline inflation was in the 2-4 per cent range in 11, 4-6 per cent in 14 and above six in nine, converging to an average rate of about 4 per cent.

The first step towards financial inclusion starts with banking the unbanked, as account ownership acts as a gateway to the formal banking system.\nFinancial inclusion, therefore, requires deliberate and structured policy interventions to extend banking services to those historically left out. To turn the principle into practice, Prime Minister Modi\u2019s maiden address from the ramparts of Red Fort announced the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), a scheme which was formally launched on August 28, 2014, under the National Mission on Financial Inclusion.\nThe vision of the mission was encapsulated in its slogan, \u201cMera Khaata, Bhagya Vidhata\u201d (My Account, Fortune Maker). It sought to bring the poor and historically marginalised into the economic mainstream, enabling access to the formal banking system and ensuring they became stakeholders and beneficiaries of India\u2019s growth story. Jan Dhan accounts allowed beneficiaries to open zero-balance and zero-charge accounts with minimal paperwork and simplified KYC/e-KYC requirements. They also provided additional features such as RuPay debit cards with in-built accident insurance cover of \u20b92 lakh, and an overdraft facility of up to \u20b910,000.\nREAD MORE", "timestamp": "2025-08-28T18:10:51.838530"}, {"title": "Decoding Trump\u2019s stance on India", "sub_heading": "The Trump administration must understand that the Modi govt will never compromise on the interests of Indian farmers", "publisher": "By Subramani Ra Mancombu\nUpdated - August 27, 2025 at 09:10 PM.", "story": "US Soybean farmers are heavily reliant on Chinese imports | Photo Credit: CESAR OLMEDO\nIf you want to know why US President Donald Trump has taken a tough stance against India, you should be among the US farmers. It may not be the only reason, but it definitely is one of the reasons. It could also be because Trump and his advisors are waiting for China\u2019s response with bated breath, which is the bull in Trump\u2019s shop.\nLast week, at the Soy Connext 2025, organised by the US Soybean Export Council in Washington, the elephant in the room was China. For nearly two decades, until 2017, the US had become very reliant on China, particularly for the export of its agricultural produce \u2014 soybeans, wheat and corn. Beijing, too, was over-reliant on the US. But it acted quickly after its first trade dispute in 2017-18 with Washington.\nChina is yet to buy any soybeans in forward sales from the new crop that is due in less than a month. Traders and US farmers fear Beijing could even do the same with corn, which will be harvested from October, and wheat.\nAnalysts say China put the US on the ropes by banning the export of critical minerals in December 2024, in retaliation for the US ban on the semiconductor industry and magnets for electric vehicles. Beijing also barred shipments of dual-use items to 12 specific US companies. It has hurt the US industry badly.\nThese Chinese actions have forced the US to put off until November additional sanctions against Beijing. Trump has threatened China with a 200 per cent tariff, but it is unlikely he will go ahead. Analysts say they would not be surprised if Trump extends the deadline for the sanctions to come into force, giving more time for a trade deal.\nSoybean economics\nAfter lobbying for 15 years, the US started exporting soybeans to China in 1997. By 2014, it had peaked at $145 billion before plunging to one-tenth of it last year at $13.5 billion. According to the American Soybean Association, China bought 25 million tonnes (mt) of US soybean in the 2023-24 marketing season.\nThe Chinese significance makes it a must for others to keep it in good humour. Beijing accounts for over 60 per cent of the global soybean imports. If China does not buy US soybeans, its export will drop 48 per cent. This is even if all its other buyers were to meet 100 per cent of their demand from Washington.\nOn its part, China has helped Brazil improve its port infrastructure and logistics. A Panamax vessel now takes 60 days to load agricultural produce compared with 120 days before the first Sino-US trade dispute. It has helped Brazil to increase its production from 95.7 million tonnes in 2015-16 to 176 tonnes in 2025-26.\nEconomists say US inflation has increased only a tad until July. But from August, it could surge with the tariffs coming into play. That will create problems for Trump, apart from the need to find markets for US agricultural produce, such as soybeans.\nThese developments have probably forced the US to target India. Whether it is Trump\u2019s decision or his advisors\u2019 suggestions, they have failed to consider the compulsions of the Modi government. It has exposed Washington\u2019s double standards, particularly in the case of targeting New Delhi for penal tariffs in buying Russian crude oil. At least twice, Modi has said he is willing to pay the price for protecting the interests of farmers and small traders. The Prime Minister knows how to cater to his electorate.\nIndian compulsions\nWhat Trump and his advisors have not taken into account is that any decision to permit imports of key crops will affect millions of small and marginal farmers, who make up over four-fifths of the total growers in India. Also, the Indian Supreme Court is still seized of the genetically modified (GM) crops issue. The ruling BJP\u2019s arms, such as Bharat Kisan Sabha and Swadeshi Jagran Manch, are opposed to GM crops.\nAs a trade expert says, it will be political suicide for any Indian government to compromise on agriculture and reservations. Fully aware of this, the Modi government seems prepared for any repercussions.\nThis is something that Trump and his advisors ought to understand. Simply expecting India to back it when it is besieged with problems from China is unwise. Targeting and threatening India because it imports 15 million tonnes of cooking oil and forcing it to buy its soybeans will just not work. The US, unwisely, thinks it can strike at India to bring Russia and China around.\nBut what it forgets is that India\u2019s agricultural trade with the US is on the rise. This oil season, ending in October, India has purchased 1.8 lakh tonnes of soybean oil so far, and this could increase in the coming years. India\u2019s poultry feed needs could lead to higher imports of soymeal from the US. The rising number of soybean crushing units in the US should help cater to this need.\nChina\u2019s ageing population is in contrast to India\u2019s youth bulge. This means Beijing\u2019s demand will flatten soon, and New Delhi\u2019s will rise.\nIf Trump and his advisors think they can make India surrender meekly like its neighbours, they are wrong. India, just as Russia and China, has nothing to lose!\nNew Delhi recovered, albeit slowly, from the break up of the Soviet Union, which was its biggest buyer of tea. It can repeat it in the textiles and fisheries sectors that heavily rely on the US. Russia and China have lent a helping hand to India. Would Trump want to risk losing India? Caution and patience are the keys to bilateral relations. Time for the US administration to understand this.\nCOMMENTS\nPublished on August 27, 2025\nREAD MORE", "timestamp": "2025-08-28T18:10:53.121585"}, {"title": "Modernise shipping laws", "sub_heading": "The Bills of Lading Act, 2025 fails to give digital, transparency boost", "publisher": "By Shashank Patel\nUpdated - August 27, 2025 at 06:00 AM.", "story": "Electronic bill of lading can ensure cost efficiency, sustainability and transparency in global maritime trade | Photo Credit: Suphanat Khumsap\nThe Parliament enacted the Bills of Lading Act, 2025, during the monsoon session. This Act has replaced the Indian Bills of Lading Act, 1856, but apart from minor restructuring, no substantial changes have been made.\nAlthough the new legislation claims to modernise maritime trade, it surprisingly lacks any provision for electronic bill of lading (eBL), whose adoption is accelerating globally. A 2024 global survey conducted by the International Chamber of Commerce revealed that the share of dual-format users (using both paper and electronic BLs) has surged from 28 per cent in 2022 to 41.7 per cent in 2024. Between the same period, the overall adoption rate of eBL increased from 33 per cent to 49.2 per cent. Further, the use of eBL in place of traditional bill of lading (BL) results in approximately 94 per cent faster processing, enhances process efficiency by up to 89 per cent, improves data accuracy by up to 87 per cent, and enhances security by 89 per cent.\nCost savings\nAccording to a study by McKinsey, ocean carriers issue around 45 million BLs annually, and 100 per cent eBL adoption can annually save approximately 28,000 trees. Also, BL accounts for 10-30 per cent of total trade documentation cost, and adoption of eBL could save around $6.5 billion in direct costs for stakeholders, and boost annual global trade growth by $30-40 billion.\nThe study further reveals that at present, customs are able to physically inspect only 2 per cent of containers. An eBL will facilitate the accurate and timely delivery of data to customs officials, allowing them to inspect cargo data and identify potential targets for inspection even before the arrival of the shipment. This will reduce the illegal trade by 10-15 per cent globally.\nTherefore, eBL alone can ensure cost efficiency, sustainability and transparency in global maritime trade. The absence of such a mechanism undermines the Act\u2019s objective of streamlining operations within the maritime sector.\nNewly inserted Section 5 grants unregulated powers to the Central Government to give directions for carrying out the provisions of the Act. Such unilateral power would leave no place for State governments, traders or industry stakeholders in policy matters. This provision will significantly hamper the federal arrangement of port management as provided under List I (27) and List III (31) of the Constitution of India.\nSection 4(1) provides that \u201cEvery bill of lading in the hands of a consignee or endorsee for valuable consideration.. shall be conclusive evidence.. against the master, notwithstanding that such goods may not have been so shipped.\u201d Many believe that this will indirectly open the doors for fake bills, hawala transactions, and fraudulent trading since it allows a BL to be treated as valid even when goods have not been shipped. Such a provision undermines the Act\u2019s objective of enhancing transparency within the maritime sector.\nThe legislation also ignores a significant problem in the modern shipping industry. Article III, Rule 3 of the Hague-Visby Rules and Articles 15(1) & 16 (1, 2) of the Hamburg Rules require the carrier to sign the BL stating the goods were \u2018shipped in apparent good order and condition\u2019, ensuring weight, quantity, etc., which becomes difficult especially in the case of gas tankers.\nIn order to avoid guaranteeing the accuracy of the weight or quantity, the masters started adding a \u201cWeight/quantity unknown\u201d clause in the BL. However, the applicability of this clause varies across the jurisdictions; for instance, non-common law countries do not recognise such a clause, whereas English law doesn\u2019t consider the BL to be prima facie evidence of the weight or quantity.\nTherefore, for an equitable and sustainable shipping industry, we need to move away not only from the colonial Act but also from the colonial mindset. A more forward-looking approach is essential to truly modernise and future-proof India\u2019s maritime trade.\nThe writer is an international trade lawyer\nCOMMENTS\nPublished on August 27, 2025\nREAD MORE", "timestamp": "2025-08-28T18:10:54.851779"}, {"title": "Trade war creating volatility in the bullion market | The Trending commodity podcast | Ep 01", "sub_heading": "Over the past 20-30 years, gold and silver have at least matched equity returns, proving to be reliable hedges against inflation, policy uncertainty, says Anindya Banerjee, Head-Commodity and Currency, Kotak Securities", "publisher": "By Subramani Ra MancombuShakthi H\nUpdated - August 23, 2025 at 03:12 PM.", "story": "In this episode of businessline\u2019s Trending Commodities, host Subramani Ra Mancombu is joined by Anindya Banerjee, Head of Commodity and Currency, at Kotak Securities to talk about the current volatility in gold and silver markets. \nBanerjee discusses how global developments such as the US Customs proposed 39 per cent tariff on gold bars and its subsequent reversal by President Trump are impacting investor sentiment and price trends.
