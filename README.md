<h3>üìà Stock Data Fetcher</h3>
Overview
Stock Data Fetcher is a Python-based solution for fetching and storing both historical and live stock market data. It leverages yfinance for easy access to daily OHLCV data and efficient web scraping to capture live Last Traded Price (LTP) and Volume directly from official market websites. All collected data is automatically formatted and inserted into a SQL Server database, empowering comprehensive analysis and reporting workflows.

<h3>Features</h3>
Historical/Daily Data:
Fetches Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and Date for NSE-listed stocks using yfinance. Supports flexible querying for single days or date ranges.

<h3>Live Data Acquisition:</h3>
Uses web scraping to obtain real-time LTP and current volume. Volumes in lakh units are intelligently converted to absolute values.

<h3>SQL Server Integration:</h3>
Inserts both historical and live data into dedicated tables:

historical_data for daily/archival records

live_data for current, scraped data
Automatically formats all numeric and date values for compatibility.
